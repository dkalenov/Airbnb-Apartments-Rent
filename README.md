# Airbnb Berlin Apartments Rent

**Project Objective:**
This project aims to assist a client who plans to invest in real estate by purchasing apartments or houses in Berlin for renting out on Airbnb. The aim is to identify the most profitable options within the given investment constraints.

**Tasks:**
1. Data Preprocessing;
2. EDA;
3. Determine the list of criteria;
4. Identify the most profitable options.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- The accommodation price is influenced by various factors such as the type of housing, number of bedrooms, location, and Airbnb rating.
- Based on the analysis, the ideal investment properties are 2-bedroom apartments or houses with 1 bedroom, located away from the city center. Achieving an overall rating above 70 is advisable for better marketability, but obtaining a Superhost award is not essential. It's not worth considering cleanliness ratings as a decisive factor in property selection.

## Further development

- Consider seasonal variations in pricing and occupancy rates.
- Develop predictive models to estimate rental prices based on various factors.
